**Gravity** is a powerful, dynamically typed, lightweight, embeddable programming language written in C without any external dependencies (except for stdlib). It is a class-based concurrent scripting language with modern <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift">Swift</a>-like syntax.

**Gravity** supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming. Thanks to special built-in methods, it can also be used as a prototype-based programming language.

**Gravity** has been developed from scratch for the <a href="http://creolabs.com" target="_blank">Creo</a> project in order to offer an easy way to write portable code for the iOS and Android platforms. It is written in portable C code that can be compiled on any platform using a C99 compiler. The VM code is about 4K lines long, the multipass compiler code is about 7K lines and the shared code is about 3K lines long. The compiler and virtual machine combined add less than 200KB to the executable on a 64-bit system.

## What Gravity code looks like

```swift
class Vector {
	// instance variables
	var x = 0;
	var y = 0;
	var z = 0;

	// constructor
	func init (a = 0, b = 0, c = 0) {
		x = a; y = b; z = c;
	}

	// instance method (built-in operator overriding)
	func + (v) {
		if (v is Int) return Vector(x+v, y+v, z+v);
		else if (v is Vector) return Vector(x+v.x, y+v.y, z+v.z);
		return null;
	}

	// instance method (built-in String conversion overriding)
	func String() {
	        // string interpolation support
		return "[\(x),\(y),\(z)]";
	}
}

func main() {
	// initialize a new vector object
	var v1 = Vector(1,2,3);

	// initialize a new vector object
	var v2 = Vector(4,5,6);

	// call + function in the vector object
	var v3 = v1 + v2;

	// returns string "[1,2,3] + [4,5,6] = [5,7,9]"
    	return "\(v1) + \(v2) = \(v3)";
 }
```

## Special thanks

Gravity was supported by a couple of open-source projects. The inspiration for closures comes from the elegant <a href="http://www.lua.org" target="_blank">Lua</a> programming language; specifically from the document <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/roberto-ierusalimschy/closures-draft.pdf">Closures in Lua</a>. For fibers, upvalues handling and some parts of the garbage collector, my gratitude goes to <a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com" target="_blank">Bob Nystrom</a> and his excellent <a href="https://github.com/munificent/wren">Wren</a> programming language. A very special thanks should also go to my friend **Andrea Donetti** who helped me debugging and testing various aspects of the language.

## Documentation

The <a href="https://marcobambini.github.io/gravity/#/README">Getting Started</a> page is a guide for downloading and compiling the language. There is also a more extensive <a href="https://gravity-lang.org">language documentation</a>. Official [wiki](https://github.com/marcobambini/gravity/wiki) is used to collect related projects and tools.

## Where Gravity is used

- Gravity is the core language built into Creo (https://creolabs.com)
- Gravity is the scripting language for the Untold game engine (https://youtu.be/OGrWq8jpK14?t=58)

## Let's get ziggy

I made a thin wrapper for gravity in zig, you can fetch it like any other zig packages,
you can pass an optional parameter to the build options: "shared"

- If set to true, the "gravity" artifact will be dynamically linked
- If set to false, it will be statically linked
- If not set, both of them will be created: "gravity" and "gravity_s", "gravity" is dynamic, "gravity_s" is static
